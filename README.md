# nextcloud_CPNV
Creation of a nextcloud server for the CPNV School

All are created by students Axel Camp and Gegory Renaud for a school project.
We build the nextcloud server with some old unused hardware and we install the server on it.
We are working for adding some modules and ameliorations and we hope the keep it for the others students
